# HEARTBEAT.md

## Scheduled Tasks

### Daily Morning Reflection (customize time)
- Review memory files and recent work
- Generate improvement ideas
- Send summary to user (if configured)

## On Every Heartbeat
1. Check if any scheduled tasks are due
2. Read ACTIVE_PROJECT.md if context seems stale
3. Only reply HEARTBEAT_OK if truly nothing needs attention

## Periodic Checks (rotate through, 2-4x daily)

### Memory Hygiene (CRITICAL)
- Is MEMORY.md current? Update if >24h stale
- Any lessons learned today that should be captured?
- Any new preferences/patterns to record?

### Post-Work Checklist
After ANY coding session:
1. ✅ Changes committed and pushed?
2. ✅ Project tracker updated?
3. ✅ Deploy verified?
4. ✅ ACTIVE_PROJECT.md current?
5. ✅ Any learnings → MEMORY.md?
